"""
Base skill chip abstractions for Kintsugi CMA.

This module provides the foundational classes and types for all 22 skill chips
in the Kintsugi CMA system. Skill chips are modular, domain-specific handlers
that process user intents and execute actions within ethical guardrails.

Key concepts:
- SkillDomain: The functional area a chip operates in (fundraising, operations, etc.)
- EFEWeights: Ethical Framing Engine weights for domain-specific prioritization
- SkillContext: Runtime context including organization, user, and BDI state
- BaseSkillChip: Abstract base class all skill chips inherit from

"""Type alias for async skill handler functions.

A skill handler is any async function that takes a SkillRequest and
SkillContext and returns a SkillResponse. This type is useful for
functional-style skill implementations or middleware.

Example:
    async def my_handler(request: SkillRequest, context: SkillContext) -> SkillResponse:
        return SkillResponse(content="Hello!")

    handler: SkillHandler = my_handler
